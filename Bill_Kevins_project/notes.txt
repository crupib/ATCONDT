1. Create a bitmap window
2. Scale the bitmap window in reals, world coordinates
3. Draw some shapes and lines in it, preferably include some circles to test proper aspect ratio.
4. Set aside that bitmap, that is, don't draw anymore in it.
5. Create another visible, normal, windows graphic screen.
6. Create some code within a DO LOOP, something like this:
    Do
             Copy STATIC Bitmap to visible screen
             Generate a random X,Y coordinate
             Draw a rectangular box and fill (paint) at that coordinate
             Draw a couple of lines through the box, maybe @ +/- 90 degrees if not too difficult
             Draw a couple of other shapes/fill/lines 
             Refresh and display the newly completed screen
             Sleep(100)  (so I can see and absorb the wonderful graphics you just created!)
    
   Loop
